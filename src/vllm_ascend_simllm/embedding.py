    Parameters
    ----------
    hidden_states:
        ``[B, S, D]`` or ``[S, D]`` tensor from the final transformer layer.
        *B* = batch, *S* = sequence length, *D* = hidden dimension.

        * ``"mean"`` — average over all token positions (excluding padding).
        * ``"last"`` — take the last token's hidden state.
        * ``"cls"`` — take the first token (BOS / CLS token).

    Returns
    -------
    ``[B, D]`` (or ``[1, D]`` if input was ``[S, D]``) L2-normalized embedding.
